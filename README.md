# Azure ETL | Data-engineering project using ADF,Databricks,Synapse and Power BI

## Introduction
This project implements a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF), Databricks, Synapse, and Power BI for end-to-end data processing and visualization. ADF fetches CSV data from an online source and stores it in Azure Data Lake. Databricks processes and transforms the data, which is then stored as an external table in Synapse. Finally, Power BI connects to Synapse for interactive reporting and visualization.
